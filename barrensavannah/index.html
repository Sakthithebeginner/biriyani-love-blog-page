            <p>The Thalappakatti Biriyani Hotel’s roots can be traced all the way back to 1957. Founded by Mr. Nagasamy Naidu under the name Anandha Vilas Biriyani Hotel in Dindigul. He always wore a turban called THALAPA(a traditional head dress), which over the years became synonymous with his brand and cooking styles, leading him to earn the nick name “Thalappakatti Naidu” which would eventually became the name of our brand and restaurants.<a href="https://thalappakatti.com/">Thalappakatti biryani</a></p>

            <p> A Biryani that was worth a war!

Legend whispers of a mythical kingdom called Behrouz, 2000 years ago, which rose to popularity around the world for its recipe of layered rice and secret spices. A recipe that lured Kings and masses alike; A dish that we now know as Biryani.

The recipe was lost forever when King Cyrus laid siege to Behrouz until it was discovered amongst the ruins. With this Biryani, we have brought back to life this lost recipe of Behrouz.<a href="https://www.behrouzbiryani.com/">Behrouz Biryani</a></p>
